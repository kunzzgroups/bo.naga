/* Does every page carry what "click a link and it swaps" needs to be smooth?

   The router can only be as smooth as the pages it swaps between. A page that is missing
   one of these still loads fine on its own, which is exactly why the gaps went unnoticed -
   they only show up as a flash, a font jump, or a full reload in the middle of a session:

     data-bo-spa    the page opted in. Without it the router refuses the target and the link
                    is a full page load - the flash the whole exercise exists to remove.
     data-bo-shell  which shell owns this page (declared, never inferred: the body-class
                    heuristic misclassified 30 of 147 pages and would let the router swap
                    between two different shells).
     frame          the content area the router swaps (.report-content). A page that opted in
                    without one can never be swapped into, and the router would still fetch
                    it first and only then fall back to a full load - slower than never
                    intercepting the link at all. It is the one marker with no exemption:
                    such a page is simply left out of the generated manifest below.
     canvas         must NOT be there. The first-paint canvas used to be injected per page; main
                    unified the page background in one place (bo-charcoal-shell.css, commit
                    d05bd7c5) and removed it from every page, because two sources for one canvas
                    made the same shell paint two different backgrounds on a page switch. A page
                    still carrying the old inline canvas is a regression of that decision.
     boot           the theme bootstrap + DOMContentLoaded registry in <head>. Without the
                    registry a swapped-in page's boot listeners cannot be replayed.
     quicknav       the rail stylesheet as a real <link>, not injected from a body-end
                    script. Late injection is what restyled the rail after first paint and
                    made the font look like it jumped.
     router         bo-spa.js itself, pinned to the file actually in the tree.

   It also owns assets/js/bo-spa-manifest.js - the list of pages the router is allowed to
   intercept a link for. Everything else (the agent portal, redirect stubs, fragments, the
   legacy layouts) is left to a plain browser navigation.
