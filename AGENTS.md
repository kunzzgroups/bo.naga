# Git workflow rules

These apply to every agent and every human working in this repository. They exist because
a single push from a stale working copy silently deleted a large amount of merged work
(see `DESIGN.md` → Merchant Detail, and commit `f76f208`).

## Always pull before you push

Fetch and integrate before pushing. Never push a branch that is behind or diverged from
its remote.

```sh
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main      # on your own branch
```

If the fetch brings in commits you did not have, integrate them first. Land on `main`
through a pull request (next section). **Measured 2026-10-01: the ruleset that used to
reject a direct push is no longer doing it.** A `git push --dry-run origin <tip>:refs/
heads/main` on a branch built on `origin/main` reported a plain fast-forward
(`74dda4e8..7a8d1788  HEAD -> main`) — the server would have accepted it, so the rule
below is a convention the team keeps, not a lock. Nothing upstream will stop a stale tree
either: that is why the pre-commit deletion guard and "verify before you claim" are the
only remaining protection for `main`.

## Never commit a whole stale tree

Before committing or pushing, look at what your commit would remove:

```sh
git diff --stat origin/main..HEAD
```

If files you did not deliberately change show up as **deleted**, stop. Your working copy is
stale and committing it will revert other people's work. Do not run `git add -A` on a copy
you have not just fetched.

## Never touch someone else's work

Do not delete, rename, force-push, or rewrite another person's branch or commits. If a push
of yours would remove files you never edited, that is a bug in your working copy, not a
cleanup opportunity.

## Work on your own branch, land through a pull request

Commit to a personal branch (e.g. `kunzzit01/dev`) and merge through a pull request.
`main` is landed on through a PR **by convention** — the ruleset that used to reject a
direct push is not enforcing it any more (measured 2026-10-01, see *Always pull before you
push* above), so nothing at the remote stops a bypass and nothing catches one after the
fact. Keep the PR anyway: the review is the only review `main` gets.

## The server is a deploy target, not a workstation

Do not edit or commit code on the server. Deploy with:

```sh
git fetch origin && git merge --ff-only origin/main
```

`--ff-only` refuses to invent a merge commit and **fails loudly** if the server has diverged
or has local changes — which is the point. A plain `git pull` on a dirty or diverged server
copy hides exactly the problem this rule exists to catch.

## The guard hook

`scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit` blocks a commit that deletes files still present on
`origin/main` — the exact shape of the `f76f208` incident. Install it in your clone:

```sh
cp scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Hooks are per-clone and are not transferred by git, so install it after every fresh clone.

A `pre-push` hook for "is my branch behind?" is **not** needed: git already refuses a
non-fast-forward push locally and never invokes the hook for it. Verified empirically. The
hole that mattered was a stale *working tree* producing a valid fast-forward, which is what
the pre-commit guard covers.

## Verify before you claim

After deploying or migrating, confirm the result rather than assuming: check the file that
should now exist, or the value that should now be applied.

## The BO shell (topbar · sidebar · content frame)

`assets/css/bo-shell.css` is the **single source of truth for every layout metric** of the
BO shell. Metrics means: `padding*`, `gap*`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `line-height`,
`letter-spacing`, `height`, `min-height`, `flex*`. Theme sheets keep colours, backgrounds,
border colours, shadows and custom properties - they do not own layout.

This exists because the same shell was re-declared ~2600 times across the module sheets
(`bo-charcoal-shell.css`, `bo-wallet-transaction-amber.css`, `reports.css`, the
`*-executive.css` family). The same sidebar row therefore sat at a different height on
different pages, and the header inset, the counter row, the counter icon outline, the
counter number line-height, the content frame width and the Logout block each drifted.
Every fix had to be forced through with `!important`. Do not reintroduce that pattern.

### The drift guard

`scripts/check-shell-drift.js` fails on a **new** metric declaration on a shell selector
in any stylesheet other than `bo-shell.css`. It is wired into
`scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit` and runs **first and unconditionally** - put it anywhere
after the deletion check and that check's `[ -z "$deleted" ] && exit 0` silently skips it
(this mistake was made once and caught by testing, not by reading).

Two shells are out of this guard's scope by construction, because AGENTS.md forbids unifying them
with the BO: a rule scoped by `data-bo-shell="main"` (the Main panel) and a rule scoped by
`[data-agent-page]` (the Agent Portal). Both attributes are stamped per page, appear on no BO page,
and therefore make a selector that a BO page can never match.

`scripts/shell-drift-baseline.json` records the declarations that already existed, so the
guard is enforceable today: only new drift fails. Remove a baseline entry when you remove
its declaration.

    node scripts/check-shell-drift.js                    # check (exit 1 on new drift)
    node scripts/check-shell-drift.js --list             # every current violation
    node scripts/check-shell-drift.js --update-baseline  # re-record the current state

The hook is per-clone (like the deletion guard above):

    cp scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

### Scope: BO pages only

The BO shell applies to the normal backoffice pages. The **Main panel** (`main-*`,
`main_*`, `menu-permission.html`) and the **agent portal** keep their own shells. Do not
unify them. The agent portal is the set of pages that load `agent-portal.js` - **not** the
files whose name starts with `agent-`: nine of those (`agent-management.html` and the module
tabs beside it: commission, payout, settlement, reimbursement, promotion, detail,
performance report and detail) are ordinary back-office pages in the BO shell, and treating
them as the portal left every click from the BO rail to them a full page load.

### Adding a BO page

The page needs three lines plus a menu row - the shell is rendered, not copied:

    <link href="assets/css/bo-shell.css?v=N" rel="stylesheet" />          <!-- in <head> -->
    <header class="report-topbar" data-bo-topbar></header>                 <!-- first in <main> -->
    <script src="assets/js/bo-topbar.js?v=1"></script>                    <!-- immediately after it -->

The script must sit **immediately after the header**: `reports.js` and `bo-theme.js` bind
`[data-open-sidebar]` / `#boThemeToggle` at `DOMContentLoaded`, so mounting during parse is
what keeps those bindings working and avoids an empty-header flash.

Title and icon come from the menu row (Menu Management) matched by URL, falling back to
`document.title`. Add a menu row for the page, or pin them on the header:

    data-bo-title / data-bo-icon    pin a title or icon for a page with no menu row
    data-bo-subtitle                optional second line under the title
    data-bo-h1-id                   when page JS uses an id on the h1
    data-bo-title-block-class       when the page wraps the title in its own class
    data-bo-title-row-class         when the title sits in a row beside a status pill
    data-bo-hamb-aria / data-bo-icon-id / data-bo-icon-aria   aria + ids on those slots
    <span data-bo-topbar-title-extra>  a live counter/badge that belongs beside the title
    <span data-bo-topbar-extra>        page-specific buttons inside the right-hand group

**Do not write shell metric CSS in the new page or in its module sheet.** Colours are
fine. The guard will refuse the commit and name the file, selector and property.

### Changing the shell design

Edit `bo-shell.css` once and every adopted page follows - that is the point. Verify by
rendering a sample across themes (a charcoal page, a `bo-wallet-tx` page, and one without
either) and comparing **computed values**, not by eye alone.

### Measuring a shell problem

Measure the element that actually carries the text or the box in question, not its
container. Two real misses in this codebase: a `letter-spacing` that made one page's
sidebar read cramped was set on the label `<span>` (inherited from the open group button's
`-0.01em`) while the row element reported `normal`; and the theme toggle's icon size lives
on `i[data-theme-icon]`, not on the button, whose inherited `font-size` does not matter.

## The SPA layer (bo-spa.js)

The team-facing guide is `SPA.md` (Chinese) - what the router does step by step, what a page
must declare, the six rules a page script has to follow, every guard and how to run it, and a
troubleshooting table. Read it before changing a page; this section is the short version.

`assets/js/bo-spa.js` makes the rail and the module-tab row swap the content frame instead
of reloading the page. It is opt-in per page via `<html data-bo-spa="1">` and only
ever intercepts a link whose destination is listed in the generated
`assets/js/bo-spa-manifest.js`. Everything else - the agent portal, the redirect stubs, the
fragments, the legacy layouts - is left to the browser, which is also the safe direction: a
link that cannot be swapped costs one navigation, never a fetch followed by a reload.

Adding a BO page means running the rollout and regenerating the manifest:

    node scripts/adopt-bo-spa.js --check     # what a page is missing
    node scripts/adopt-bo-spa.js             # stamp it
    node scripts/check-spa-readiness.js --write-manifest
    node scripts/pin-spa.js

### What the router guarantees

A swap is meant to be indistinguishable from a full load, and these are the parts that make
it so - each one was a measured difference first:

- **The stylesheet set only grows, deliberately.** The router adds the target's sheets and never
removes one. The shell's own CSS (`bo-charcoal-shell.css`, `bo-module-tabs.css`,
`bo-global-quicknav.css` ...) is linked by whichever page needs it, and the page you navigate to
routinely does not link it, so removing "sheets the target does not declare" strips the shell:
measured, the module tab row came back at padding-left 0 / margin-right 0 on
casino-overview-report.html, and bo-charcoal-shell.css itself vanished on the way back to
member-deposit.html. A few extra sheets in a long session is the smaller price.
- **A page can declare its own content frame** with `data-bo-frame` on the element to swap
(`currency-management.html` uses `.cur-page`, `main-dashboard.html` uses `#mainExec`). When
the two pages disagree about the frame, the element itself is replaced rather than only its
children - otherwise the legacy markup lands inside the standard frame and keeps the standard
frame's padding.
- **The page-level permission check re-runs** (`BO_AUTH.enforcePageAccess`). It lives in
auth.js's boot, which a swap does not repeat, so without this a swappable link was a way onto
a page the account's menus do not include.
- **Destinations are prefetched on hover/focus/touch**, into a bounded document cache
(16 entries). A pointer swept down the rail cannot evict a page the user actually visited.
- **The visible state is settled before the target's scripts run**, so the title, the lit tab,
the active rail row and the scroll position move with the click instead of waiting 2-300ms
for the scripts. They are re-asserted afterwards, because a script may rebuild the tab row.
- **A page's own scripts run again every time it is entered.** Only files the page you are
leaving also loads are skipped (auth.js, reports.js, bo-topbar.js - global side effects that
must not happen twice). This matters because a page script usually ends with a plain call
(`promotion-workspace.js` ends with `load()`) and registers no DOMContentLoaded listener, so
"already executed in this session" meant the list was never rendered again: reported as
"switch back to Promotion Bonus and the data is incomplete".
- **Everything else the page owns travels with it**: body-level elements outside the shell
(the modal markup), and the page's own siblings after the frame inside `.report-main`
(`slider-edit.html`'s `<footer id="bannerEditFooter">` holds the Save/Reset row). Marked at
parse time, removed on the next swap, replaced by the target's.
- **Per-document marks on the body are cleared per swap.** `crud-modal-pattern.js` sets
`body.dataset.crudModalReady` so it lifts a page's form card into its modal only once - and
the body survives a swap, so the mark suppressed that work for every later page while the
modal kept the previous page's card (two elements with the same ids, and a modal showing the
wrong form). Its stale card is dropped and the init runs again.

### The readiness and pin guards

`scripts/check-global-collisions.js` refuses a page script that declares a global
(`const`/`let`/`class` at the top level of the file, outside any IIFE) which another page
script also declares. On a full load only one page's scripts run; a swap runs the target's in
the same global scope, the second declaration is a SyntaxError and that script does nothing at
all. It walks each file with a small tokenizer, because a column-based scan flags the
thousands of declarations that sit inside a file-wide IIFE and cannot collide.

`scripts/check-spa-readiness.js` tests every page for the markers a smooth swap needs
(`data-bo-spa`, a content frame - `.report-content` or `data-bo-frame` - the first-paint
canvas, the head bootstrap and DCL registry, the static quicknav `<link>`, the router tag at
the current pin) and refuses a built manifest that no longer matches the tree.
`scripts/pin-spa.js` refuses a commit whose pages still request the previous revision of the
router or the manifest - a browser that cached it keeps running it for the whole session,
which is indistinguishable from a fix that did not work.

Both run in `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`, unconditionally, before the deletion check's
`exit 0`. A page that is in the shell but genuinely not a swap target belongs in
`scripts/spa-readiness-baseline.json` with a reason; a page without a `.report-content`
frame is left out of the manifest instead.

### Diagnosing a swap that goes wrong

    BO_SPA.report()          # JSON string: every navigation with the ms offset of each phase
    BO_SPA.debug.navlog()    # the same as records
    BO_SPA.debug.canSwap('x.html')   # why a link did not swap (no fetch, no navigation)

Each navigation logs one line per phase (`fetched` / `content` / `scripts` / `ok`). A swap
that wedges writes the phase it was stuck in into the record as the 8s watchdog gives up and
falls back to a full load, so the failure names its own cause. Kill switches:
`localStorage.bo_spa = '0'` or `window.BO_SPA_OFF = true`.
