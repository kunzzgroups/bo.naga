/* The shared transaction page: one document, three views (Deposit / Withdraw / All) selected by
   `?tab=`. This file is the view controller - it shapes the markup for the Withdraw view, sets the
   title and lights the tab, then makes sure the module that owns the view is loaded, once.

   It is re-runnable on purpose (`data-bo-spa-rerun` on its tag in member-deposit.html). The BO
   router swaps the content frame in place, so entering ?tab=withdraw from ?tab=deposit runs this
   file again against the fresh frame instead of reloading the page. Two consequences, both
   load-bearing:

     - The frame arrives deposit-shaped on every entry (the target document is member-deposit.html
       for all three views), so the Withdraw shaping is re-applied every time - and the Deposit view
       has to undo what the previous view left on the <body>, which is not part of the frame and
       survives a swap.
     - `window.BO_TX_VIEW` names the view that owns the shared table right now. All three scripts of
       this page stay loaded after a swap, so a module whose view is gone has to be able to tell:
       two live copies of the same click delegation would toggle one bank chip twice. */
