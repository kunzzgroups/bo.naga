/* BO client-side navigation ("B") - opt-in per page via <html data-bo-spa="1">.
 *
 * The BO is an MPA, so following a link threw the document away and re-mounted the whole
 * shell. This keeps the shell mounted and swaps only the content frame, which is what a
 * client-side router does: the rail, topbar and account block are never rebuilt and the
 * content area is never empty, so the white first-paint moment cannot happen either.
 *
 * WHY THE FIRST ATTEMPT WAS PARKED, AND WHAT CHANGED
 * It shipped site-wide once and broke the target page's own render - "the module tab row
 * and filter card never came back until a manual reload". Two independent causes, both
 * fixed here:
 *
 *   1. This file re-ran only the target page's script when its FILE NAME matched the page
 *      (base === file). index.html has no index.js, so a click on any rail link landed on
 *      an inert document: the script that builds the page was never executed.
 *      Now every script the target document carries that this document has not yet run is
 *      executed, in document order (see runScripts).
 *
 *   2. Every page's own script defers its work to `DOMContentLoaded`:
 *          document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => { ...loadMembers(); });
 *      A swap never fires that event again, so even a correctly re-run script sat there
 *      having registered a listener that would never be called. After the scripts have
 *      run, this file REPLAYS DOMContentLoaded (see replayLifecycle). That replay is why
 *      the shared handlers had to be made idempotent - they hear it too, and the shell
 *      they bind to is the same DOM they bound to on the previous page.
 *
 *   (3. Third cause, now moot but worth recording: the section tab row is not part of the
 *      fetched document at all - renderModuleTabs builds it at runtime and inserts it
 *      INSIDE .report-content. Swapping the content frame therefore deleted it. apply()
 *      calls renderModuleTabs again after the swap, which rebuilds the row for the new
 *      page from location.pathname - so it is correct for a page in another module too,
 *      not just restored.)
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO startViewTransition HERE
 * The shell was once left on screen as a half-transparent snapshot of itself (rail, tab row,
 * tiles, table header all faded) until something forced a repaint, and the conclusion on this
 * codebase was explicit: "navigation is a plain cut again, which never ghosts" (63e02220,
 * "Remove the view-transition rules"). That revert took out the CSS side (@view-transition,
 * the shortened crossfade, the shell view-transition-names); the JS entry point survived it
 * inside this file while this file was parked. It is not used, because a ghost is a rendering
 * artifact - it does not show up in a DOM level assertion, so it cannot be verified here, and
 * the safe default is the one that was already paid for once.
 *
 * SCOPE - deliberately narrow, because it now runs site-wide
 *   - it only takes over clicks on the module tab row, the rail, the Dashboard pin bar
 *     and anything explicitly marked [data-bo-spa-link]; every other link on the page
 *     behaves exactly as before;
 *   - the fetched page must build the same shell family as this one, and must itself
 *     carry data-bo-spa="1", otherwise it falls back to a real navigation;
 *   - any error, missing frame, cross-origin target, modified click or failed fetch falls
 *     back to a real navigation, i.e. today's behaviour.
 *
 * Kill switches, without touching a single page:
 *   localStorage bo_spa = '0'   or   window.BO_SPA_OFF = true
